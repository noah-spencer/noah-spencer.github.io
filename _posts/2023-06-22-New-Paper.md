## New Paper: Bacterial Transcription Under Extreme Genome Reduction and Extreme Genome Fragmentation

Today, [the official typeset and corrected version of my first first-author paper is out in *Genome Biology and Evolution*!] (https://academic.oup.com/gbe/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gbe/evad100/7189782?rss=1) This story was a lot of fun to unravel, in part because it centers on a really unique system. I've already talked a little about the content of the work on social media, so, rather than rehashing that, I will probably post a write-up from a slightly different perspective on here in the coming days that places the paper in a broader context.


In the meantime, do check out the paper! It's the first of my PhD, and I'm so stoked to have it out in one of my favorite journals. The submission, review, and publication process was great, and I'm very thankful to the folks at GBE and Oxford University Press as well as to my co-authors John, Piotr, Mariah, and Claudio.
