## Hi! I'm Noah.

I'm an Evolutionary Biology PhD student at Arizona State University. During my undergraduate studies in my home state of West Virginia, I fell in love with insect endosymbionts while working in Dr. Rita Rio's lab. My current research in [John McCutcheon's lab](http://mccutcheonlab.org) (part of ASU's Biodesign Center for Mechanisms of Evolution) focuses on the cicada endosymbiont *Candidatus* Hodgkinia cicadicola and its [crazy genome instability](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/cicada-brood-x-bacteria-chaos/618808/). I use transcriptomics and various imaging techniques to characterize the cell biological consequences of these extreme changes in *Hodgkinia*'s genome size and organization. In general, I am interested in how endosymbiosis ⁠— which has produced some of the simplest cellular organisms ⁠— can also produce astonishing biological complexity through both adaptive and non-adaptive mechanisms.
