      <p>Originally from Morgantown, West Virginia, I received my BS in Biology from West Virginia University in 2021. It was here that, through my work on tsetse flies under Dr. Rita Rio, I was introduced to the study of endosymbiosis — cells living stably inside of other cells. Shortly thereafter, I left for Arizona to work in <a href="https://mccutcheonlab.org">John McCutcheon's lab</a> where I study the <em>Hodgkinia cicadicola</em> endosymbionts of cicadas.</p>
      <p>As much as I love trudging around with an insect net and conjuring up shell scripts in GNU Emacs, I was drawn to science less as a naturalist or as a computer geek and more as a reader, writer, and performer. Biology, being both a quantitative and an historical science, was particularly appealing to this sort of inner poet because it seemed to involve so many great stories — ones in which improbable outcomes not only occur but have long-lasting and wide-reaching consequences.</p>
      <blockquote><p>A mature physicist, acquainting himself for the first time with the problems of biology, is puzzled by the circumstance that there are no 'absolute phenomena' in biology. Everything is time-bound and space-bound. The animal or plant or micro-organism he is working with is but a link in an evolutionary chain of changing forms, none of which has any permanent validity.</p></blockquote><p>—Max Delbrück, <cite>A Physicist Looks at Biology</cite></p>
