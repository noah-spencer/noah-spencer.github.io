      <p>Originally from Morgantown, West Virginia, I received my BS in Biology from West Virginia University in 2021. It was here that, through my work on tsetse flies in Dr. Rita Rio's lab, I was introduced to the study of endosymbiosis â€” cells living stably inside of other cells. Shortly thereafter, I left for Arizona to work in Dr. John McCutcheon's lab, where I have been studying the <em>Hodgkinia cicadicola</em> endosymbionts of cicadas ever since.</p>
      <p>As much as I love trudging around with an insect net and conjuring up shell scripts (in GNU Emacs, of course), I was drawn to science less as a naturalist or as a computer geek and more as a sort of artsy storyteller seeking real-life tales of wonder and mystery. I have developed a deep appreciation for the craft of scientific writing and of visual storytelling through microscopy and data visualization.</p>
