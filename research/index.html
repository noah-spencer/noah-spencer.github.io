      <h2>Building a Molecular Atlas of Periodical Cicadas' Complex <em>Hodgkinia</em> Endosymbionts</h2>
      <p>In periodical cicadas, one of the insects' nutritional endosymionts is highly fractured at the cell level: the essential genes in the endosymboint's genome are spread across a complex of distinct, chromosome-like genomic molecules which are, themselves, "trapped" in separate endosymbiont cells and unable to recombine or physically interact. I am currently studying the spatial distributions of those genes' products at the RNA and protein level to understand how these many cells and cell types funciton as one in the face of an unprecedented cell biological challenge.</p>

	<h2>Transcriptional Consequences of Genome Instability in <em>Hodgkinia</em></h2>
      <p>Genome instability and fragmentation in cicada endosymbionts can severely skew the dosage (or relative copy number) of endosymbiont genes, whether by two-fold or over a hundred-fold. I used genome and transcriptome sequencing data from the endosymbiont-containing tissue of six different cicadas exemplifying various degrees of endosymbiont genome instability and found that similar instability was present in the transcriptomes with no detectable compensation for the dosage skew. By comparing co-endosymbionts of cicadas with differing degrees of gene loss in transcription-related genes, I was also able to show the impact of these gene losses on processes like transcription termination. All of that work is detailed in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/15/6/evad100/7189782">this paper</a>!</p>

<h2>Molecular Mechanisms of Symbiosis Establishment: Tsetse Flies & <em>Sodalis praecaptivus</em></h2>
<p>My very first project explored how a free-living bacterium, <em>Sodalis praecaptivus</em>, whose close relatives have repeatedly become insect endosymbionts, establishes in tsetse flies (which also host <em>Sodalis</em>-related endosymbionts). <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S193131281730149X?via%3Dihub">Just as in weevils</a> the way these bacteria establish in insect hosts is mediated by quorum sensing, and we also found some evidence that the introduced bacteria could be transmitted vertically to offspring in tsese (which, notably, give live birth to larvae — one at a time!). <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1008992">You can read about that work here!</a>
